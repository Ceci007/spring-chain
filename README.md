# Spring Chain
We built a custom select component with a menu with animations and beautiful gradients and a glassy style, is called "Spring Chain" because of how the animation is built, you can select any gradient from the list and the menu is displayed as a grid.

We also made use of the "spring chain" (react-spring library) to make some perfect animations.
